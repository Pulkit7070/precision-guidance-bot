# Precision Guidance Bot

A Vite + React + TypeScript frontend for the Precision Guidance Bot project.

This repository contains the single-page application used as the project's UI. It does not rely on the Lovable platform — any previous Lovable scaffolding and dependencies have been removed.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js (18+) and npm.

```powershell
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd precision-guidance-bot
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on http://localhost:8080 by default.
